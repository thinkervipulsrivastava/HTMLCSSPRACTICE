        <h1>Why I love Taos, N.M.</h1>
        <h2>The sun is strong and the people are weird.</h2>
        <p>Taos is a small town in the mountains of northern New Mexico. It's cooler than the southern part of the state, because it's 7,000 feet high. Many of the residents are high, too. (But not me. I'm weird without any help.)</p>
        <p class="important">Warning: We have no slow lorises here.</p>
        <h2 class="typewriter">This heading is in typewriter text.</h2>
        <p class="typewriter">This paragraph is also in typewriter text.</p>
        <h2 class="emphasized">Some people italicize and bold too much.</h2>
        <p>I <em>really</em> feel that <span class="emphasized">some</span> writers use <i>way</i> too much bold and an <strong>incredible amount</strong> of italics when they could use <b>far fewer</b> of these text effects.</p>
