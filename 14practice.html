        <h1>Why I love Taos, N.M.</h1>
        <h2>The sun is strong and the people are weird.</h2>
        <p>Taos is a small town in the mountains of northern New Mexico. It's cooler than the southern part of the state, because it's 7,000 feet high. Many of the residents are high, too. (But not me. I'm weird without any help.)</p>
        <p class="important">Warning: We have no slow lorises here.</p>
        <h2 class="typewriter">This heading is in typewriter text.</h2>
        <p class="typewriter">This paragraph is also in typewriter text.</p>
        <h2 class="emphasized">Some people italicize and bold too much.</h2>
        <p>I <em>really</em> feel that <span class="emphasized">some</span> writers use <i>way</i> too much bold and an <strong>incredible amount</strong> of italics when they <span class="standout">could</span> use <b>far fewer</b> of these text effects.</p>
        <p class="spacey">It's great to be able to control spacing between letters, words and lines, but, unless you're a professional designer, it's a good idea not to try to be too creative with these options.</p>
        <h3>Centered headings can look very nice.</h3>
        <p class="pretty">Justified text has always been used by professional designers. Before word processing came along, justification made text look professionally "typeset" since a typewriter couldn't do it. But now that almost any word processor can even out the right edge, justification doesn't have the prestige it used to enjoy. And, if a block of text is narrow, with few words per line, things can get pretty ugly, thanks to all those big gaps between words. These days, it's harder to justify justification.</p>
